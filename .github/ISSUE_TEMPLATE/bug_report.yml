        Steps to reproduce.
        
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        >
        > - To rule out another plugin causing the issue, please start with a [minimal config](https://github.com/mrcjkb/rustaceanvim/blob/master/troubleshooting/minimal.lua).
        > - Please refer to the readme's [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/mrcjkb/rustaceanvim?tab=readme-ov-file#stethoscope-troubleshooting).
        > - Please provide exact (repeatable) steps, including project initialization (if applicable).
        > - Avoid screenshots when possible, as they are hard to read and (more importantly) don't allow others to copy-and-paste your code.
