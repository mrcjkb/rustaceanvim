Introduction                                                             *intro*

This plugin automatically configures the `rust-analyzer` builtin LSP client
and integrates with other rust tools.

                                                                        *ferris*


Commands:

 `:RustAnalyzer start` - Start the LSP client.
 `:RustAnalyzer stop` - Stop the LSP client.

The `:RustLsp` command is available after the LSP client has initialized.
It accepts the following subcommands:

 `runnables [last]?` - Run tests, etc.
                       `last` means run the last test that was run.
 `expandMacro` - Expand macros recursively.
 `moveItem [up|down]` - Move items up or down.
 `hover [action|range]` - Hover actions, or hover over visually selected range.
 `openCargo` - Open the Cargo.toml file for the current package.
 `parentModule` - Open the current module's parent module.
 `joinLines` - Join adjacent lines.
 `ssr [query]` - Structural search and replace.
 `crateGraph [backend]` - Create and view a crate graph with graphviz.
 `syntaxTree` - View the syntax tree.
 `flyCheck` - Run `cargo check` or another compatible command (f.x. `clippy`)
              in a background thread and provide LSP diagnostics based on
              the output of the command.
              Useful in large projects where running `cargo check` on each save
              can be costly.

plugin configuration                                             *ferris.config*


ferris.nvim is a filetype plugin, and does not need
a `setup` function to work.

To configure ferris.nvim, set the variable `vim.g.ferris`,
which is a `FerrisOpts` table, in your neovim configuration.

Example:
>
---@type FerrisOpts
vim.g.ferris = {
   ---@type FerrisToolsOpts
   tools = {
     -- ...
   },
   ---@type FerrisLspClientOpts
   server = {
     on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
       -- Set keybindings, etc. here.
     end,
     ['rust-analyzer'] = {
       -- ...
     },
     -- ...
   },
   ---@type FerrisDapOpts
   dap = {
     -- ...
   },
 }
<

Note: `vim.g.ferris` can also be a function that returns a 'FerrisOpts' table.
